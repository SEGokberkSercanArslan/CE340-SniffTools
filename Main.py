      Available services are as follows; type in function name to use it:
      [icmp] : Ping an IP range and collect IP addresses of the hosts that are alive and save the result. 
      [ports] : Find and identify ports on valid live hosts and save the results. Uses the file from service [icmp]. 
      Run icmp first before running this service.
      [open-ports] : Scan valid live hosts, find open ports from each host and save the results. 
            Again, uses the file created by [icmp]. 
      [OSdetection] : Identify operating systems (OS) and OS versions of the hosts with open ports. 
            This service uses the file created by [open-ports]. 
      [web] : Scan and find 10 web-server addresses, protocols, and ports of each web server. Save the result. 
      [syn-flood] : Launch SYN-flood attack to a given destination (IP) and port(s).
       [sniff] : The tool provides to listen network given filter configuration.
      [show] : Display the results files created so far. \n
