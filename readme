Made by Gökberk Sercan ARSLAN and Selin CANDEMİR.

Welcome to Scapy Tool.

To use this program, run main.py .

As you run main.py, a brief explanation of the services provided will be printed out
into the terminal as the first thing.

To use a service, type the word in the brackets [] verbatim.
 example: OSdetection

Each service will take necessary inputs from user, after you have chosen a service.

For [icmp]: Input 1 for single IP; 2 for range of IP, then spacify lower and upper bounds.
For [ports]: No input needed, but run [icmp] before running this service.
For [open-ports]: No input needed, but run [icmp] and [ports] before running this service.
For [OSdetection]: No input needed, but run [icmp] before running this service.
For [web]: Input 10 web addresses to check if they are online.
For [syn-flood]: Input target IP, then ports, then how many times you want to attack (# of packets).
For [show]: Input which file you want to see.

Best regards.
